# ios-TMRow
ios-TMRow (ios-TextMessageRestorer) allows deleted text messages to be viewed.

## About the name
I had a few ideas for the name
- ios-STINKS (ios-SuperText... uhhhh idk), wasn't chosen because I couldn't figure out what it stood for
- ios-STUNK, wasn't chosen because I couldn't figure out what would stand for either
- ios-TMR, wasn't chosen because I figured out a better name
- ios-TMRw, stands for "ios-TextMessageRestorer", the w makes it spell out "TMRW", slang for tommorow.
- That changed into "TMRow", for added coolness

## About the project
Basically, I accidentally deleted an old iOS convo with myself that held some important notes. The convo had some other people in it too, so I was able to grab the notes and move them to a Notepad file. However, one of my friends was nice enough to mention the fact that in the file: `3d0d7e5fb2ce288813306e4d4636395e047a3d28` in his iOS backup, there was a SQLite3 DB with text messages (including deleted ones).

And so, ios-TMRow was born. It started out as a simple script to view those deleted messages. And then, a few months later, ios-TMRow was born.

## When will there be code here?

At some point.
